# MuraComments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction
This is a Mura CMS plugin to manage comments all in one place. This makes it easy to do things that Mura doesn't do out of the box such as bulk deletes, bulk approvals, etc.

Simply login to the Admin, go to Settings > Plugins, select MuraComments and everything should be self-explanatory from there.

Currently, only Super Users are able to access the plugin. This may change in a future version.

### Minimum Requirements
	* Mura CMS v.6.0+ (6.0.5238+ for email notifications to work)
	* Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1+ or Railo 3.3+

### Tested On
	* Mura CMS v.6.0.5238
	* Adobe ColdFusion 10.0.7
	* Railo 4.0.2
